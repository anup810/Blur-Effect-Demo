# Explore Blur Effect

This SwiftUI project demonstrates how to apply blur effects and blend modes to different shapes and gradients. The project includes interactive sliders to adjust blur radii and a tap gesture to switch between blend modes.

## Features

   git clone https://github.com/anup810/Blur-Effect-Demo.git
   ```
2. Open the project in Xcode
3. Run the app on an iOS simulator or device

## Usage

* Adjust blur effects using sliders
* Tap anywhere on the screen to cycle through blend modes

## Components

* **BlurEffectDemo.swift**: Main view containing background gradient, shapes, and sliders
* **BlendedCircleView.swift**: Reusable SwiftUI view for colored circles with blur and blend effects
* **SliderTextView.swift**: Custom slider component to control blur radius

## Learning Objective

This project is built to explore and understand how SwiftUI handles blur effects and blend modes.
